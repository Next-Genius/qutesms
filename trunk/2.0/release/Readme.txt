For QuteSms to work, you have to install:

- libqt4-core, libqt4-gui, libqt4-network and libqt4-xml. 
(the packages names may differ from distro to distro so just serach for libqt4 something and install Core, GUI, Network and Xml).

- After having installed libqt4, you have to give the application (file QuteSms) the right to be exectued 
(right click -> Properties -> Permissions -> is Executable, or 'chmod +x QuteSms' in a shell) 

- Then simply double click on it.
